Usage examples in `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ for the procedure
``pPXF`` originally described in `Cappellari & Emsellem (2004) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C>`_,
substantially upgraded in `Cappellari (2017) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C>`_
and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in
`Cappellari (2023) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C>`_.


``pPXF`` extracts the galaxy stellar and gas kinematics, stellar population and
gas emission by fitting a set of templates to an observed spectrum, or to a
combination of a spectrum and photometry (SED), via full-spectrum fitting.

One can run the Jupyter notebooks without installing anything by clicking on the
binder button above. Just note that the code will run much faster on your
local computer.
